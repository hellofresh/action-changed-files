Generate a GitHub Actions job matrix based on changed files (with an extra twist).

## Problem statement

Repositories are often composed of multiple modules or directories that are built & deployed differently. They can represent a part of the system, or a specific environment. Modules like this also often share some common files.

The (traditional) and easiest way to guarantee that all changes are properly tested in CI is to run all jobs for every single change, but this can lead to a very long verification time.

Ideally, you want to be able to trigger (and skip) jobs based on the contents (and type) of a change.

[Trigger paths](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-including-paths) and [matrix job strategy](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix) are two great features that can help reducing verification time, but they're still not flexible enough.

## Example

### Sample repository

`neo` helps with generating a job matrix based on the changed files in a pull-request, or after merging it to the target branch.

Consider the following repository directory structure:

```
├── infrastructure
│   ├── live       # depends on terraform-modules
|   |── staging    # depends on terraform-modules
├── library
│   ├── common
│   ├── parser     # depends on library/common
│   ├── network    # depends on library/common
|── terraform-modules
|── deploy.sh      # used in CI to deploy infrastructure
|── Makefile       # used in CI to build library
```

and that we want to:

* verify & deploy changes to infrastructure as code affecting the `live` and `staging` environments
* build & test changes to `library/parser` and `library/network`

### Sample workflow

```yaml
name: Sample workflow

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  generate-matrix:
    name: Generate job matrices
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # don't forget to declare outputs here!
    outputs:
      matrix-infrastructure: ${{ steps.neo-infrastructure.outputs.matrix }}
      matrix-library: ${{ steps.neo-library.outputs.matrix }}
    steps:
      - name: Generate matrix | Infrastructure
        id: neo-infrastructure
        uses: hellofresh/action-changed-files@v3
        with:
            pattern: infrastructure/(?P<environment>[^/]+)
            default-patterns: |
                terraform-modules
                deploy.sh

      - name: Generate matrix | Library
        id: neo-library
        uses: hellofresh/action-changed-files@v3
        with:
            pattern: library/(?P<lib>(?!common)[^/]+)
            default-patterns: |
                library/common

  infrastructure:
    needs: [ generate-matrix ] # don't forget this!
    strategy:
      matrix: ${{ fromJson(needs.generate-matrix.outputs.matrix-infrastructure) }}
    if: ${{ fromJson(needs.generate-matrix.outputs.matrix-infrastructure).include[0] }} # skip if the matrix is empty!
    steps:
        - name: Deploy infrastructure
          run: echo "Deploying ${{ matrix.environment }}"

  build:
    needs: [ generate-matrix ]
    strategy:
      matrix: ${{ fromJson(needs.generate-matrix.outputs.matrix-library) }}
    if: ${{ fromJson(needs.generate-matrix.outputs.matrix-library).include[0] }}
    steps:
        - name: Building library
          run: echo "Building ${{ matrix.lib }}"
```

Let's break down what will happen here with a few examples:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Changed files</th>
        <th>Behaviour</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            infrastructure/live/main.tf<br>
            infrastructure/staging/main.tf<br>
        </td>
         <td>
            jobs.deploy[live]<br>
            jobs.deploy[staging]<br>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            library/parser/json.c<br>
            library/network/tcp.c<br>
        </td>
         <td>
            jobs.build[parser]<br>
            jobs.build[network]<br>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            terraform-modules/aws.tf<br>
            library/common/printer.c<br>
        </td>
         <td>
            jobs.deploy[live]<br>
            jobs.deploy[staging]<br>
            jobs.build[parser]<br>
            jobs.build[network]<br>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Change statuses

Each matrix entry in the output JSON will also be annotated with an additional `reason` field that can help handling corner-cases like deleting a directory. If all matches of a set of groups have the same status, the `reason` field will be set to it.

Example: if you use pattern `(?P<module>database-us|database-fr)` and all files in the `database-us` directory are deleted, the job matrix will look like:

```json
[
    {
        "module": "database-us",
        "reason": "deleted"
    },
    {
        "module": "database-fr",
        "reason": "?"
    }
]
```

The same applies to any status, like `added` or `modified`.

Note: if a pattern matching to the same set of groups were caused by multiple type of changes, the `reason` field is marked as `?`.

### Logging and debugging
By default the log level for the action is `INFO` but can be overriden by setting `NEO_LOG_LEVEL` env variable 
example:
```yaml
  sample-job:
    name: Test action
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      matrix: ${{ steps.sample-step.outputs.matrix }}
      matrix-length: ${{ steps.sample-step.outputs.matrix-length }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Generate matrix
        id: sample-step
        uses: hellofresh/action-changed-files@v3
        env:
          NEO_LOG_LEVEL: DEBUG
        with:
          pattern: (?P<dir>[^/]+)/
          defaults: true
          default-patterns: |
            .github/**

```
